# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning
As a Data Scientist, this project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating house prices based on key features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and additional amenities. By 

leveraging historical real estate data, we aim to identify patterns and relationships between property attributes and their market value.

## Key Objectives:
Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Collect and clean housing market data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, correlations, and influential factors impacting house prices.

Feature Engineering: Enhance dataset quality by selecting and transforming relevant variables.

Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting techniques (XGBoost, LightGBM).

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.

Optimization & Deployment: Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy and deploy the best-performing model for real-world use.

This project serves as a data-driven approach to real estate valuation, helping buyers, sellers, and analysts make informed pricing decisions.
